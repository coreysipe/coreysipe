### Welcome to my profile! ðŸ‘‹

I am a junior majoring in Computer Information Systems and minoring in Data Analytics at Stetson University.

Some of my interests are:
  - Web application development (I like frontend more but generally enjoy both as a whole)
  - Software development (recent project: mobile app with route optimization and safety features (SOS button) for home healthcare workers)
  - Video & card games
  - Playing & listening to music

Projects I am looking forward to starting on my own time:
  - Harry Potter sorting hat program
  - Dungeons & Dragons character creation application
  - Text adventure RPG game (though overdone, this one is more for my own fun)
  - Fake company/university website (to practice my skills)
  - Website incorporating all my fun applications via a home page that leads to other pages.

If you have any ideas you think would be cool to see, let me know!
