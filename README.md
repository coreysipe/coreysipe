### Welcome to my profile! ðŸ‘‹

I am a senior majoring in Computer Information Systems and minoring in Data Analytics at Stetson University.

Some of my interests are:
  - Web application development
  - Software development
  - Video & card games

I graduate May 2025 and look forward to becoming a Web Developer! 

Why create something if you're not proud of your creation?
